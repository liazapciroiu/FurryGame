# Furry Game

This was a project to be made in the week studying remote from Coders Lab. 
A game developed in JavaScript Vanilla with the aim to better grasp the concepts though before, like DOM Manipulation, conditionals, loops, constructor functions, working with objects, timed functions, user input. 

It is fairly addictive so I invite you to click here (https://liazapciroiu.github.io/FurryGame/) and play it. Use the arrow keys to move Furry around the board and try not to hit any walls. Each marble that Furry eats earns you one point.
